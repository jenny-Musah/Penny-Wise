# Penny-Wise
# Technical Design Document

## Purpose
This document aims to provide a detailed design for the backend system of  Pennywise and also establish a clear understanding of the systemâ€™s architecture, and components, it's also guides the implementation of features to ensure alignment with business goals and technical standards.

## Introduction
Pennywise is an innovative e-saving platform designed to empower users to save efficiently and manage their finances smarter. The platform provides a comprehensive suite of features, including automated deductions, manual transfers, budgeting tools, saving reminders, save-locking mechanisms, and diverse savings plans. With a focus on usability and security, Pennywise aims to simplify the process of financial discipline while offering flexibility for both long-term and short-term savings goals.

The backend system is the core engine that ensures the seamless operation of these functionalities. This Technical Design Document (TDD) outlines the architectural framework, key modules, and implementation strategies for the backend. It serves as a roadmap for developers, detailing the core objectives, design considerations, and technologies that will enable the delivery of a robust and scalable platform.

## Objectives
List the goals and objectives this design aims to achieve. For example:

- [ ] Primary Objective: To develop a secure, robust, and scalable platform that efficiently supports core saving functionalities such as automatic deductions, manual transfers, budgeting tools, saving reminders, and saving plans. The system aims to ensure seamless management of both long-term and short-term savings goals while prioritizing the security of user data and financial transactions. Additionally, it seeks to establish reliable communication between components through well-structured RESTful APIs, adhering to industry standards and best practices to deliver a dependable and user-friendly platform.

- [ ] Secondary Objective: To optimizie the system for high performance and scalability to handle increased user activity and transactions. It also aims to facilitate seamless integration with third-party payment platforms like Paystack for secure operations while maintaining a modular design that allows for future enhancements. Furthermore, the backend will incorporate comprehensive testing frameworks and advanced error-handling mechanisms to minimize downtime and ensure reliability. Compliance with data protection and financial regulations is also a priority, fostering user trust and confidence in the platform.
